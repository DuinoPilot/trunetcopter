A ChibiOS multicopter code.

Using on FEZ Cerb40 STM32F4 board with FreeIMU v0.4r3,
S.BUS RX and 24LC256 EEPROM and up to 8 PWM motors.

Some code and ideas from:
- MultiWii
- Autoquad
- Diydrones Arducopter
- Madgwick
- Baseflight/Baseflightplus from afrodevices T.C.
- CH Robotics
- i2cdev libraries files
- barthess u: https://github.com/barthess/u
